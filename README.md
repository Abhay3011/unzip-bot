# **Special branch made if only YOU will use the bot**
Less functionalities, but :  
+ It still works well
+ You can do everything the main bot does, except all managing stuff
+ No need to create a DB, neither a channel
+ Made for **personal use only**
+ You will have no control if someone else use this version

## Found a bug 🐞

If you found a bug in this beta version please open an [issue](https://github.com/EDM115/unzip-bot/issues) or report it at [me](https://t.me/EDM115)  
I didn't tested it, so it may crash 😅 but I'm nearly sure it's okay  
Same if you have any feature request ☺️
